# GitHub Pages Configuration for craftx.elevatecraft.org

## Setup Steps

### 1. DNS Configuration (Already Done)

Your current DNS setup looks good:

```txt
Type: A
Name: craftx
Content: 172.67.194.63
Proxied: Yes
```

### 2. GitHub Pages Settings

1. Go to your repository settings: <https://github.com/davidanderson01/CraftX.py/settings/pages>
2. Set source to "Deploy from a branch"
3. Select branch: `main`
4. Select folder: `/ (root)`
5. Custom domain: `craftx.elevatecraft.org`

### 3. CNAME File (Created)

The CNAME file has been created with `craftx.elevatecraft.org`

### 4. Verify Setup

After GitHub processes the configuration:

- Visit: <https://craftx.elevatecraft.org>
- Check HTTPS certificate is working
- Test all pages load correctly

### 5. DNS Propagation

DNS changes can take up to 24-48 hours to fully propagate.

## Troubleshooting

### If the site doesn't load

1. Check GitHub Pages settings
2. Verify DNS propagation: `nslookup craftx.elevatecraft.org`
3. Check Cloudflare proxy settings
4. Ensure CNAME file is in repository root

### SSL Certificate Issues

1. GitHub Pages will automatically provision SSL
2. May take a few minutes after initial setup
3. Cloudflare proxy should be compatible
