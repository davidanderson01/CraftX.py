- Suspicious behavior suggesting credential harvesting attempts
- Multiple failed authentication attempts despite correct passwords

- ‚úÖ **Updated documentation** to recommend VS Code deployment only

### Security Recommendations

1. **Never use Remix IDE** - Use local VS Code deployment instead
2. **Monitor wallet activity** - Check Sepolia testnet transactions regularly
3. **Use local tools only** - Deploy directly from your development environment
4. **Verify all transactions** - Double-check contract addresses and transaction details

**Use VS Code Local Deployment:**

```bash
node scripts/simple_deploy.js
```

**Why this is safer:**
