### 📚 Documentation (`docs.html`)

The error message indicates that the fenced code blocks in your Markdown should specify a language for syntax highlighting. This is a good practice as it helps with readability and understanding of the code.

Here’s the corrected code snippet with the language specified for the code blocks:

```markdown
### Local Testing

```bash
# Start local server
python -m http.server 8000

## 🌍 Live Deployment

To deploy to GitHub Pages:

1. **Push to GitHub**:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add static website"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Enable GitHub Pages**:
   - Go to repository Settings
   - Scroll to Pages section
   - Select "Deploy from a branch"
   - Choose "main" branch
   - Select "/ (root)" folder

3. **Access Your Site**:
   - Your site will be live at: `https://davidanderson01.github.io/CraftX.py/`

In this corrected snippet, I ensured that the code blocks for both local testing and GitHub deployment commands are properly marked with the `bash` language for syntax highlighting. This should resolve the error you encountered.
